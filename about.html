      <p>I am Tommy Blount, I am 15 and a student at York Tech School of Technology.
        I am in the IT program. I have not done much programming, but I have on and
        off been programming a couple things for the last few years. This website is
        for my programming class so that we can learn HTML, CSS, and some JS. The "Get to School" tab
        has the RPGMaker game that we have also been working on. Seeing as we don't have a full
        year to work on this, the game might not get finished. If I am able to, over the summer
        I might expand on it. If you have any feedback about the game or website, the best ways to contact me
        are in the "socials" tab.</p>
